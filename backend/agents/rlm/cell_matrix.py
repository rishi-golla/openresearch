"""Cell-matrix aggregation — turn one-GPU-per-cell results into harness metrics.

The risk-H core of the 2026-05-31 OOM/GPU remediation.  ``gpu_cell_runner``
solves *placement* (one physical GPU per cell, OOM retries) but each cell only
writes a tiny FLAT leaf dict for its single ``(model, env, baseline)`` triple.
The harness scorer (``backend/evals/paperbench/leaf_scorer.py``) and the
postflight scope guard (``rubric_guard._validate_scope_metrics``) consume a
single nested ``metrics.json`` shape::

    {
      "status": "complete" | "partial" | "failed",
      "per_model": {
        "<model_key>": {
          "<env>": {
            "<baseline>": {"status": "ok"|"failed", "metric": <float|null>, ...}
          }
        }
      },
      "scope": {
        "models_run": [...], "models_skipped": [...],
        "environments_skipped": [...], "gaps": [...]
      }
    }

This module owns the *translation*.  It is intentionally **pure**: no
``RunContext``, no ``nvidia-smi``, no network unless a probe is injected.  Every
function takes data in and returns JSON-serialisable data out, so the entire
contract is testable without a GPU, a torch install, or a live endpoint.

Three pure stages, composed by the caller in order:

1. :func:`capacity_gate` — drop cells whose estimated VRAM (× headroom) exceeds
   a single GPU's budget, BEFORE any subprocess is launched.  Never blocks on
   unknown capacity.  Emits ``capacity`` gap entries + ``models_skipped``.
2. :func:`dataset_url_preflight` — probe each distinct ``dataset_url`` once and
   drop cells whose endpoint is CONFIRMED dead (HTTP 404/410).  **Fail-soft**: a
   transient/unknown probe result NEVER drops a live env (the 2026-05-31
   requirement — a single network blip must not silently de-scope WebShop).
   Emits ``dataset_unavailable`` gap entries + ``environments_skipped``.
3. :func:`aggregate_cell_metrics` — fold the ``run_matrix`` result + the
   surviving cells into the canonical nested shape above, merging in the
   capacity/dataset gaps and skip lists from stages 1–2.

The env is keyed DIRECTLY under the model (no ``per_dataset`` wrapper) — this
matches the real on-disk SDAR sample
(``runs/.../code/outputs/.../metrics.json``) and the postflight's single-model
fast path.  Do NOT add a ``per_dataset`` layer.

Zero non-stdlib dependencies (``json`` / ``urllib`` / ``typing`` only), so this
file is copy-pasteable into an agent sandbox exactly like ``gpu_cell_runner``.
Auth-agnostic by construction (no provider branching, no LLM calls).
