"""Auto root-cause classifier for failed run_experiment results.

Every recent failure mode this session falls into a small set of
recognisable shapes — ``ModuleNotFoundError``, ``CUDA out of memory``,
RunPod 500 ``RUNPOD_CAPACITY_EXHAUSTED``, the 755 MB torch wheel that
truncated mid-stream, requirements.txt missing, attempt_isolation
PermissionError, etc.  Classifying them programmatically and surfacing
the class + a concrete suggested fix in the ``experiment_completed``
event makes the next iteration's ``repair_context`` actionable instead
of an opaque traceback the agent has to re-diagnose every time.

The classifier is called from ``_persist_experiment_result`` AFTER the
result dict is finalised but BEFORE the SSE event fires.  Adds two
keys to the payload:

  ``failure_class``  one of the literals in :data:`FAILURE_CLASSES`
  ``suggested_fix``  a one-line operator/agent-actionable hint

Fail-soft: any exception inside classify_failure returns
``("unknown", "")`` — observability MUST NEVER break the run.
