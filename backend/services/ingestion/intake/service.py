"""IntakeAppService — the IO boundary that orchestrates intake.

Handles two commands:
  - RegisterProject(source) -> project_id
      Creates (or returns existing) Project aggregate with deterministic
      project_id derived from the source. Idempotent on retry.
  - FetchPaper(project_id)
      Calls the matching fetcher (PdfPathFetcher for PdfPath sources)
      and appends PaperFetched (success) or PaperFetchFailed (failure).

This is where IO happens. The Project aggregate validates state
transitions; the service performs IO and appends the resulting
events to the event store with optimistic concurrency. The aggregate
NEVER calls IO.
