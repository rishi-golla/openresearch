"""Project aggregate — state-machine ONLY. No IO.

The aggregate enforces transition validity and emits the events that
record state changes. It does NOT call HTTP, read files, or invoke
parsers. That's the application service's job (see service.py).

Replay: state is rebuilt by feeding events one-by-one to `apply()`.
Test rules:
  - Aggregate methods that produce events are pure functions of
    (current_state, command).
  - `apply()` is idempotent in the sense that applying an already-applied
    event again advances state correctly (we re-apply during load from
    the event store).
