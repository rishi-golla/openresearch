    Default model is gpt-4o-mini — cheap enough for the routing and
    leaf calls that RLM generates, strong enough for focused Q&A.

    ``max_tokens`` defaults to 4096: primitive callers (``verify_against_rubric``,
    ``propose_improvements``) and the PaperBench leaf scorer return structured
    JSON that does not fit in a few hundred tokens — too small a ceiling
    truncates the response mid-object and the caller fails to parse it.
