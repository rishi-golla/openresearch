"""EventStore + Subscription + StoreCapabilities Protocols.

Implementations:
  - `backend.eventstore.sqlite_store.SqliteEventStore` — production default.
  - `backend.eventstore.jsonl_store.JsonlEventStore` — debug / ops dump.
  - Future: EventStoreDBStore, PostgresEventStore, NatsEventStore (fan-out).

The Protocol is **fully sync** to match teammate's persistence layer
(see spec §15.13). Concurrency is achieved by SQLite's WAL mode + per-
aggregate locks. Threading drives parallel projections and coordinators.

    Subscriptions are durable across process restarts: the same
    `(subscription_name, consumer_id)` pair resumes from the last
    ack'd position.

    Ack ordering contract:
      Acks MUST be in `global_position` order. Calling `ack(event_n)`
      without first having ack'd every event up to `event_n - 1` is
      undefined behavior — the implementation MAY raise or silently
      advance, depending on backend. The recommended consumer pattern
      is "iterate, handle one at a time, ack after each, on failure
      nack and stop." Concurrency-tolerant designs use multiple
      consumer_ids on the same subscription_name (each gets its own
